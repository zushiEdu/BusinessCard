# Business Card

This is my business card. It's a little special.

My business card is a PCB, using the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller as it's brain.

The STM32 is connected to 6 push buttons and a 12x12 LED matrix. The push buttons and LED matrix are laid out to look like a GameBoy Classic. 

The business card has a collection of common engineering related symbols, values, equations, and footprints on the back.

The STM32 is programmed to simulate John Conway's Game of Life. The push buttons allow you to control the game board and the power of the system.

The Up/Down/Left/Right buttons move the cursor around when in edit mode. While in edit mode, a cursor will flash and the user can press B to toggle the selected pixel.

To Pause/Play the game, the user can press A. While the game is paused the user can edit the board.

Some cool patterns are printed across the front of the PCB.

The QR code to my portfolio, and some contact info is also on the front of the PCB.
